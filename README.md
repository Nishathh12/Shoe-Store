# Shoe-Store

In this project, we'll create a responsive shopping website frontend using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. The site will feature a modern, user-friendly design with a homepage, product listings etc. Bootstrap will be used to ensure the layout is responsive and visually appealing across all devices. The navigation bar, product cards, and checkout forms will be styled using Bootstrap components and utility classes. This project will demonstrate the effective use of Bootstrap to streamline the development of a professional-looking shopping website.
